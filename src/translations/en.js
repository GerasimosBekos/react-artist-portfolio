        aboutMeText: "My approach to this tradition is one of study and apprenticeship based on the works of great woodcarvers, \
                which reveal knowledge, experience, sensitivity, high technique, and which are often the imprint of ecclesiastical \
                experience on inanimate material, as much as possible. My collaboration with experienced craftsmen aims at the successful \
                continuation of the art of woodcarving. My brother Theofilos, theologian and cantor, is a companion in this effort. \
                I hope, with God's grace, for future personal contact and collaboration.",
